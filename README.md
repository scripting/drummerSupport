# Drummer Support

A public site for support of <a href="http://drummer.scripting.com/">Drummer</a> users. 

### What is Drummer?

Drummer is a web scripting environment built around outlining and JavaScript.

A <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer">blog post</a> I wrote about Drummer, in development, in April 2021. 

v2.0.9, the first public version of Drummer, was released on October 10, 2021.

### Quick overview

Please give <a href="http://drummer.scripting.com/">Drummer</a> a try.

We're basically retracing the steps that led to Frontier from a user scripting standpoint. Only this time the language is JavaScript, and the <a href="http://scripting.com/code/docserver/?verb=op.go">verb set</a> applies to files and apps that exist in the cloud. 

There are new features in the outliner and more to come. The tabs system is new. Bookmarks are new, and they have surprising power -- they point to individual headlines in outlines, they're like permalinks. I think this method will lead us to cloning, I think we're actually pretty close now. I was never that big a fan of cloning, but people really like it, at some point it should happen. 

An <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml">Electron version</a> of Drummer for the Mac is available. I am using it every day to write Scripting News. I have it hooked into my CMS via an icon with an attached script that makes HTTP calls. 

<a href="http://scripting.com/code/docserver/?verb=op.go">Verb docs</a> are available now. 

### Docs

There are lots of docs! Here are some of them. You'll see links to others in the sidebars, and in the Docs menu in Drummer.

For developers there are also docs that explain <a href="http://this.how/opmlChecklist/">how to support OPML</a>, and provide working code in JavaScript. OPML is the file format for outlines in Drummer. It's also a widely used format in the RSS world.
