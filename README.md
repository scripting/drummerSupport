# Drummer Testing

A private site for support of early Drummer users. 

### What is Drummer?

Drummer is a web scripting environment built around outlining and JavaScript.

A <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer">blog post</a> I wrote about Drummer, in development, in April 2021. 

### Quick overview

As a member of this site you are invited to give <a href="http://drummer.scripting.com/">Drummer</a> a try.

You can do that now, or later -- no rush. This product isn't shipping for a while.

I invited you because some of the examples I'm posting will probably interest you. We're basically retracing the steps that led to Frontier from a user scripting standpoint. Only this time the language is JavaScript, and the <a href="http://scripting.com/code/docserver/?verb=op.go">verb set</a> applies to files and apps that exist in the cloud. 

There are new features in the outliner and more to come. The tabs system is new. Bookmarks are new, and they have surprising power -- they point to individual headlines in outlines, they're like permalinks. I think this method will lead us to cloning, I think we're actually pretty close now. I was never that big a fan of cloning, but people really like it, at some point it should happen. 

An Electron version of Drummer for the Mac is coming. I am using it every day to write Scripting News. I have it hooked into my CMS via an icon with an attached script that makes HTTP calls. 

<a href="http://scripting.com/code/docserver/?verb=op.go">Verb docs</a> are available now. 

### Docs

Drummer is very much in development mode, but some of the docs are already available. 

* <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/scripting.opml">Scripting in Drummer</a>

* <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/instantOutlines.opml">Instant outlines</a>

* <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/">DocServer</a> -- a collection of docs for the verb set.

* <a href="http://drummer.scripting.com/davewiner/drummer/changeNotes.opml">Change notes</a> (opens in Drummer)

For developers there are also docs that explain <a href="http://this.how/opmlChecklist/">how to support OPML</a>, and provide working code in JavaScript. OPML is the file format for outlines in Drummer. It's also a widely used format in the RSS world.  

### Only deal-stopper bug reports for now...

The only <a href="https://github.com/scripting/drummerTesting/issues">bug reports</a> I want at this time are problems that are preventing you from getting work done. 

Say what you were doing, what you expected to happen, what actually happen. Screen shots are good. Remember we're not there with you.

You can post updates on what you're doing as <a href="https://github.com/scripting/drummerTesting/issues">issues</a>.
