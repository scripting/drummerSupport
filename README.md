# Drummer Testers

A private site for support of early Drummer users.

### Quick overview

As a member of this site you are invited to give Drumer a try.

<blockquote><a href="http://drummer.scripting.com/">http://drummer.scripting.com/</a></blockquote>

You can do that now, or later -- no rush. This product isn't shipping for a while.

I invited you because some of the examples I'm posting will probably interest you. We're basically retracing the steps that led to Frontier from a user scripting standpoint. Only this time the language is JavaScript, and the verb set applies to files and apps that exist in the cloud. 

There are new features in the outliner and more to come. The tabs system is new. Bookmarks are new, and they have surprising power -- they point to individual headlines in outlines, they're like permalinks. I think this method will lead us to cloning, I think we're actually pretty close now. I was never that big a fan of cloning, but people really like it, at some point it should happen. 

An Electron version of Drummer for the Mac is coming. I am using it every day to write Scripting News. I have it hooked into my CMS via an icon with an attached script that makes HTTP calls. 

<a href="http://scripting.com/code/docserver/?verb=op.go">Verb docs</a> are available now, they're part of the development process, so they should stay up to date. 

### Deal-stopper bug reports only for now...

The only bug reports I want at this time are problems that are preventing you from getting work done. If something is broken and in your way, report it. Say what you were doing, what you expected to happen, what actually happen. Screen shots are good. Remember we're not there with you.
