   * file.xxx verbs review
      * Decided for now that the file verbs will not run against local files. I want to be more careful about this.
      * file.exists ("happy.opml")
         * false
      * file.writeWholeFile ("hello.txt", "Hello World")
         * true
      * file.makeFilePublic ("hello.txt")

         * Hello World
   * Electric Drummer
      * I've checked out most of the cool Drummer stuff in the Electron version and it's working nicely.
      * I really need the capabilities of a desktop computer to do all the docs I am working on. I have a lot better control of the content here, and in a pinch I can run a Frontier script against this data. 
      * I figure a few more days before I'm working on non-Electron stuff. In a way it's lucky the weather is so yucky this weekend. 
* May 26
   * Electric Drummer
      * I have private files working now. 
      * I can create them, and they sync up to electricserver (same one EO syncs to)
      * the goal here is to be able to us eDrum to edit everything EO does, including Scripting News
      * In the next session I will test all the special outlines
* May 24
   * Electric Drummer progress report
      * The tabs work, you can use it to edit stuff, just like Drummer.
      * Obvious next steps
         * Bring in the menu bar from Drummer
            * Review each of the commands, do they make sense, here?
            * Use EO as prior art.
         * Download all the files from the drummer server, and move them into a folder here
            * These will be the real copies
         * Go through EO and start listing the custom Electron-only features that need to be moved
            * Two immediate examples, image uploader, and public outlines
            * Enough so I can use this to write Scripting News and this.how docs
* May 23
   * I'm working on the Electron version of Drummer
      * Making good progress, but it's slow.
      * The payoff -- one outliner, not two.
      * Any changes made in one automatically are in the other. 
* May 19
   * Code grooming, preparing for the Electron version
      * In Drummer codebase,
         * remove all references to previous tab system. Most of it is commented out already.
            * the thing to search for is appPrefs.ixCurrentTab. It doesn't exist any longer. Any code that references it is for the old tab model.
         * update the repo, review the code by scrolling through, look for more problems
         * implement file reading and writing via callbacks in newOutlineInTab
            * in Electric Drummer, these callbacks will write to the local file system 
         * move as much general functionality into a file that can be included in Electric Drummer
            * drummer functionality that is above the file functionality 
      * I forked the Electric Outliner code base, it's running. 
         * I'm going to completely remove the outliner and replace it with code that calls into the shared code 
* May 17
   * Changed the way autosave is configured. 
      * Generally want to make it more conservative, less save-happy. ;-)
      * Instead of resetting on a keystroke, we reset on a user action, which could include a mouse click, or whatever we think should delay the save to keep the machine responsive for the user. 
      * We also don't do more than one autosave every X seconds.
   * I was using double-square brackets incorrectly 
      * In previous notes, I was using them as categories, but they're actually file names.
      * I refer to a file in double-square brackets, like a link. 
      * If I click on such a link and there is no page with that name, I am offered the chance to create it. 
      * That was borrowed from wikis. 
   * This feels slow
      * Not sure if this is for real or just in my mind.
         * I just typed this section, after reloading the app, and it's very fast.
         * I'm going to have to figure out how to do profiling of background processes.
         * Oh after pausing a bit, it just slowed down. But now it's fast again.
         * I have four tabs open
            * Dave status (this file)
            * Drummer todo
            * verbDocs
            * scratchpad
      * Maybe the slowness is connected with auto saving
         * &nbsp;
   * Cleanup work on op.getSelectedText and op.replaceSelectedText.
      * op.getSelectedText ()
         * "change notes"
      * op.replaceSelectedText (string.upper (op.getSelectedText ()))
         * "OUTLINE"
* May 16
   * Status outline
      * I archived the February, March and April sub-outlines in files that are now included. 
      * This file is now much smaller.
   * Archived change notes
      * Changes I made while reorganizing the tabs in Drummer, with little or no updates to status outline.
   * [[Verbs]]
      * Two new op verbs.
         * op.getSelectedText
         * op.replaceSelectedText
* May 15
   * [[Drummer]]
      * Bumped version to 2.0.3.
      * The popover linked to the file icon in the tabs now reflects what's in the file, has been tuned up, looks good. 
      * We get as much info as we can from the <head> section of the opml text, which means we must read the file even if the tab isn't open. 
      * There's a difference between what we show for instant outlines relative to our own outlines, but the user probably won't notice. 
      * Updated so that now the title of instant outlines changes if the author changes the title, without you having to click on the tab, as does the information in the popovers. 
      * Unless there are bugs, the popovers are finished now. 
* May 14
   * [[Drummer]]
      * When you hover over the title of a tab you see the description from the <head> section of the OPML file.
         * This works even if you haven't activated the tab, ie the OPML hasn't "officially" been read yet. 
* May 13
   * New howto for outliner devs
      * Checklist of examples, specs, advice on supporting OPML in apps. 
   * New Twitter app
      * Drummer is no longer hitching a ride on Little Outliner. 
      * It's got its own app. So you'll have to log off and log on.

      * local includes
         * If the url attribute of an include node begins with file:// it's interpreted as a local include.
         * Instead of reading the file over http, which requires that it be public, it reads the file using the API. 
         * If you have a folder structure on the server, you can reflect that in the url, for example:
            * file://project1/plan.opml

            * example of a remote include

                        * Alaska is the largest U.S. state by area and the seventh largest subnational division in the world. It is the third least populous and the most sparsely populated state, but by far the continent's most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel, with an estimated population of 738,432 as 2015‰¥ämore than quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland.[4]
                           * Approximately half of Alaska's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. The state capital of Juneau is the second largest city in the United States by area, comprising more territory than the states of Rhode Island and Delaware.
                     * California
                        * California is a state in the Pacific Region of the United States. With 39.5 million residents across a total area of about 163,696 square miles (423,970 km2), California is the most populous U.S. state and the third-largest by area. 
                           * The state capital is Sacramento. The Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area are the nation's second- and fifth-most populous urban regions, with 18.7 million and 9.7 million residents respectively.[13] Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second-most populous, after New York City. California also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County. The City and County of San Francisco is both the country's second most densely populated major city after New York City and the fifth most densely populated county, behind only four of the five New York City boroughs.

      * Coolest new feature in a while.
      * Now when you use cmd-/ in an outline, if the returned value is an object, array or any combination there of, instead of inserting the result as text, we build the structure in an outline, generating valid JSON if you copy/paste the text.

            * choose a file that isn't already open from Bookmarks menu
            * reload the page
            * the file you opened will not be in the tabs
         * I think it's as simple as calling prefsChanged () after opening a new file
            * It was, the problem appears to be fixed.

      * twitter.getTweet was returning the unprocessed object that Twitter sends us.
         * I rewrote it so that it returns a simplified object, with the information a script might need. 
         * twitter.getTweet
      * Updated twitter.getThread so it returns the same info about a tweet as twitter.getTweet does.

      * Back to work on Drummer after almost a full month working on the new tabs implementation, which makes large files perform much better, since they stay in memory over a tab switch. Also will be easier to add features to the UI because we're using a big closure for each tab.
