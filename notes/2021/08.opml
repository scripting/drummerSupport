				<outline created="Mon, 30 Aug 2021 20:28:01 GMT" text="Of course I was looking in the wrong place. Staring at code that wasn't working and not questioning whether or not it worked.

				<outline created="Mon, 30 Aug 2021 20:28:46 GMT" text="So here's the setup.">
					<outline created="Mon, 30 Aug 2021 20:28:58 GMT" text="At least two tabs open, one is an instant outline, the other could be anything."></outline>

					<outline created="Mon, 30 Aug 2021 20:29:24 GMT" text="A change comes in for the instant outline. Since it is not frontmost, we stash the opmltext somewhere out of the way until the user activates the I/O by clicking in its tab. (I/O is the shorthand for instant outline.)"></outline>

					<outline created="Mon, 30 Aug 2021 20:31:10 GMT" text="Drummer then starts activating the I/O.

					<outline created="Mon, 30 Aug 2021 20:32:50 GMT" text="But if it's still doing the activation when it installs the opmltext, it will go into the other outline, which is now not visible."></outline>
					<outline created="Mon, 30 Aug 2021 20:33:22 GMT" text="And it shows the I/O but the old version of it. Since you don't know what to expect, you don't notice it."></outline>

This clearly was not good behavior. Now when you delete a day in your blog, the day will not appear in the rendering. That's the change, simple enough. Almost like fixing a bug, but not really. If you're expecting to be using Drummer for blogging for a while, as it appears some of you are, please read the next parts carefully."></outline>
				<outline created="Mon, 30 Aug 2021 17:54:58 GMT" text="This approach would not work for my blog, Scripting News, because I have to remove stuff from the outline to keep its size manageable. I do it every month, start with a clean slate. But when I do that there is no change in the home page of the blog. Tomorrow, on the first day of September there will still be 25 days on the home page. This is done using a cache that Old School maintains. "></outline>
				<outline created="Mon, 30 Aug 2021 17:56:05 GMT" text="Since prior to Drummer I was basically the only user of Old School, everything was cool. Now I can get the behavior I need by setting a config option called &lt;i&gt;flOldSchoolUseCache&lt;/i&gt; and setting it true. Then (hopefully) Old School knows to use the cache (there could be a bug in the implementation). This will get a test on September 1 when I do the rollover. I will hold my breath when doing it.

					<outline created="Mon, 30 Aug 2021 18:13:56 GMT" text="You have to be careful in what you do. That's a basic rule of computer use, you won't get far if you just bang on the keyboard trying random stuff out.

Maybe a simple function that allows you to pop a tab off into a new window, in read-only mode. I don't want to replicate all of Drummer's functionality that way, not even sure it oculd be made to work. But a read-only outline, that could work.

The user must not be locked into Drummer because you use Old School, and vice versa. It isn't enough to say we offer this, we will need second implementors to hook in both ways. Other blogging CMSes that can receive a blog as an OPML file, and other OPML editors that hook up to CMSes. I'm doing what I can by offering this combination to get the ball rolling, to provide both chickens and both eggs. :smile:"></outline>

And it kept drifting as social media came along, people wanted to cross-post to Twitter, Facebook, Medium -- and Google Reader limited the kind of post it would accept, and we tried to accomodate, until finally in 2017 I said &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;I want my old blog back&lt;/a&gt;, and I started over.

				<outline created="Wed, 04 Aug 2021 15:11:08 GMT" text="I traced the problem to the parameter encoding code, so I rewrote it for all of Drummer's server calls, so when a param is undefined, we just don't copy it. That appeared to fix the problem in the Twitter calls, but it could conceivably break things in other calls. At this point in the life of Drummer, I'd like to fix these things, and take a chance on breakage. "></outline>
