Not sure what I'm going to do with it, but I wanted you all to see it. These are instant outlines, that means the reader app opens a socket to the server the file comes from and when it updates, gets the latest version and shows that.

At first he thought it was E/D but the problem shows up in web Drummer too. This is going to be a new thing to look out for. Problems that are unique to one version or the other. The thing to know is that most of the code, except for dealing with files, are identical in the two products. That was one of the toughest parts of the project, coming up with an internal API that made that possible. In the previous product, LO2 and Electric Outliner did not share a common code base, which made maintenence so difficult it was better to completely reorganize the code. "></outline>

The programmers were busy working on other things, so I told him to just pick a name and go with it, thinking there would be a moment when we could change it if we came up with something better. We didn't. The name he came up with was UserTalk. I hated that name. It means nothing, and it's a lie. Programming isn't for people we think of as users. It's almost a definition of what a user is, someone who doesn't program. "></outline>
