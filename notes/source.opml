							<outline text="It appears to the user that an outline in an inactive tab is actually present in some way, but it isn't. The outline isn't loaded until you activate it.

							<outline text="The reason it appeared that only the title was changing was that Drummer was reading all the tweets each time.

This new way Drummer works was a month-long project to re-do how the tabs work, so you won't have to wait for all the outlines to load before you can use the one you want to work with. As my outlines were getting larger, this had become a serious usability issue. This &quot;corner-turn&quot; was done earlier this year, in April if I recall correctly.

At first he thought it was E/D but the problem shows up in web Drummer too. This is going to be a new thing to look out for. Problems that are unique to one version or the other. The thing to know is that most of the code, except for dealing with files, are identical in the two products. That was one of the toughest parts of the project, coming up with an internal API that made that possible. In the previous product, LO2 and Electric Outliner did not share a common code base, which made maintenence so difficult it was better to completely reorganize the code.

We didn't. The name he came up with was UserTalk. I hated that name. It means nothing, and it's a lie. Programming isn't for people we think of as users.

At this point in the life of Drummer, I'd like to fix these things, and take a chance on breakage. " created="Wed, 04 Aug 2021 15:11:08 GMT"/>
